# Design Compiler (DC) - Synthesis

This folder contains all files and documentation related to the RTL synthesis of the 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using Synopsys Design Compiler.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents

- `alu.tcl` : Main synthesis TCL script to run analysis, elaboration, compilation, and output generation.
- `constraints.sdc` : Design constraints file defining timing and physical constraints such as input/output delays.
- `library_setup.tcl` : Library and environment setup script for Synopsys Design Compiler.
- `images/` : Visual snapshots documenting key synthesis stages:
  - ALU block diagram
  - Post-elaboration hierarchy
  - Compile step
  - Compile Ultra step
- `reports/` : Detailed synthesis reports covering:
  - Area utilization
  - Timing analysis
  - Power estimation
  - Quality of Results (QoR) summary

## ðŸ”§ Synthesis Flow Summary

1. Read RTL source files (Verilog).
2. Load technology library files (`.db`).
3. Apply constraints from the `.sdc` file.
4. Elaborate and compile the design, including advanced optimizations.
5. Generate synthesis reports and output netlists.

## ðŸ“‹ Output Files

- Synthesized netlist (e.g., `alu_mapped.v`), suitable for further backend flow.
- Multiple reports describing synthesis results for area, timing, power, and cell usage.

## ðŸ§  Notes & Recommendations

- Verify `.db` library and `.sdc` constraints match your target technology and implementation tool (e.g., ICC2).
- Use `write -format ddc` to generate design checkpoint files for downstream tools.
- Review the images folder to understand synthesis progression visually.
- Always check reports for potential timing violations or optimization opportunities early in the flow.

This organized setup facilitates clarity and ease of use for synthesis engineers and reviewers working with the 4-bit ALU RTL in Synopsys DC.
