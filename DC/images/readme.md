# Synthesis Flow Images for 4-bit ALU

This folder contains important visual documentation captured during different stages of the 4-bit ALU synthesis process using Synopsys Design Compiler.

## Images Included

1. **Block Diagram of 4-bit ALU**  
   A high-level block representation of the 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit, showing input/output ports and internal logic blocks.

2. **Post-Elaboration Image**  
   Shows the design and RTL module instantiations after elaboration, providing insight into the structural organization of the ALU design.

3. **Compile Step Image**  
   Captures synthesis results and optimizations observed at the initial `compile` step, illustrating area, timing, or other metrics obtained.

4. **Compile Ultra Step Image**  
   Displays the enhanced synthesis results after running the advanced `compile_ultra` optimization step, highlighting improvements in performance or size.

## Purpose

These images document key milestones in the synthesis flow, helping to visualize and understand the evolution of the design through elaboration and successive optimization stages.
