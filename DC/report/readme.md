# Synthesis Reports for 4-bit ALU

This folder contains the detailed synthesis reports generated after performing synthesis of the 4-bit ALU design using the Synopsys Design Compiler (DC) tool.

## Included Reports

- **Area Report:**  
  Provides information on the silicon area utilized by the synthesized design, including cell counts and estimated chip area.

- **Power Report:**  
  Details the estimated power consumption of the design, including dynamic and static power components based on the synthesis conditions.

- **Timing Report:**  
  Shows timing analysis results such as path delays, setup and hold times, slack values, and critical path identification.

- **QoR (Quality of Results) Report:**  
  Summarizes key synthesis metrics including area, power, and timing, providing an at-a-glance overview of the overall synthesis quality.

## Purpose

These reports enable evaluation and verification of the synthesized ALU design's performance against design requirements and constraints. They are essential for guiding further optimization steps and ensuring the design meets timing, area, and power goals.
